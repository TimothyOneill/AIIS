* Pre-processing
- Upon casual inspection, I didn't spot any images that were washed out in comparison to the others.
- Conversion to grayscale for simplicity. The amount of information lost by converting to grayscale is negligible.

- Images neg/{524, 2801, 2951} came as grayscale

* Feature Extraction
- Raw pixel based uses the raw images (training.images)
- Dimensionality reduction uses PCA because reasons, and LDA is apprantly more prone to overfitting
- HOG notes here ??

* FILES WE DIDN'T WRITE
- subplot_tight.m from http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30884-controllable-tight-subplot/content/subplot_tight/subplot_tight.m
- hogFeatureCalc.m && showHog.m are Jesus's and are taken from Practical4.
- SVM is taken from the built in toolboxes
